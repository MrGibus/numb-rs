# numb_rs
An experimental package for numerical operations written entirely in rust.

**important:** This package is experimental at this stage and should not be used for any purpose other than 
tinkering with the concept itself. It is not expected to be either efficient, or practical. 
Please see the ndarray crate if you're looking for something useful. 

## Goal
The primary aim of the package is to replicate a small portion of blas and lapack functionality using inline assembly.
